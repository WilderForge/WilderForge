/**
 * This mixin fixes a JVM crash caused by incorrect particle count handling in the {@code renderBucket()} method. 
 * The crash occurs because {@code particlesToDraw} is incremented unconditionally, even when no particle data is written 
 * in {@code writeParticleVerts()}, leading to invalid rendering data being passed to the native code and eventually causing 
 * a segmentation fault.
 * <p>
 * The patch works by redirecting the field access to {@code particlesToDraw} in {@code renderBucket()} to prevent it from 
 * being incremented. Instead, the {@code particlesToDraw} count is increased only if {@code writeParticleVerts()} 
 * successfully writes particle data to the vertex writer. This is accomplished through the {@code increaseParticlesIfSuccessful} 
 * method, which compares the vertex position before and after the {@code writeParticleVerts()} call to determine if any vertices 
 * were written.
 * <p>
 * Additionally, a safeguard is added to ensure that {@code particlesToDraw} is not incremented twice in case the developers 
 * fix the underlying issue in {@code writeParticleVerts()} in future versions of the game. The check 
 * {@code if (particlesToDraw <= prevParticlesToDraw)} ensures that the particle count is only incremented if it hasn't 
 * already been increased by any other fix, preventing double counting.
